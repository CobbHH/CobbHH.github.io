          <p class="margin-bottom-24px">To understand why computers before the introduction of the GUI and then mouse were inaccessible, we have to go to the beginning of computers. The ENIAC was … that used vacuum tubes, these vacuum tubes were large and unreliable and would often break… The ENIAC was also programmed with punched cards, which was slow and tedious (SOURCE). The invention of the transistor at Bell&nbsp;Labs solved the problems of vacuum tubes as they were reliable and very small (University of Texas). Here is what a modern-day transistor looks like.</p>

RESEARCH) created an interface for&nbsp;a radar system which was hard wired with valves in the ships, data was sent via radio and the data sent was stored on magnetic drums. The displays were made with analog circuits, and dots were used to represent other ships on the radar. (Akass, Clive)</p>
